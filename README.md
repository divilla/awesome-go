* [dbr](https://github.com/mailru/dbr) - query builder and other additions to Go's database/sql for super fast performance and convenience.

* [ozzo-dbx](https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-dbx) - db driver and query builder (reference)

* [fuckdb](https://github.com/hantmac/fuckdb) - generates a go compatible struct type with the required column names, data types, and annotations just fill in the database information in the web UI. Making go web develop very easy by saving a lot of time writing structure.fuckdbis based/inspired by the work of Seth Shelnutt's db2struct, and Db2Struct is based/inspired by the work of ChimeraCoder's gojson package gojson.

* [DBQ](https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/dbq) - lightweight Dapper like db driver for PostgreSQl and MySQL

* [MaxMind DB Reader](https://github.com/oschwald/maxminddb-golang) - MaxMind DB Reader for Go

## Validators

* [ozzo-validation](https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation) - idiomatic Go (golang) validation package. Supports configurable and extensible validation rules (validators) using normal language constructs instead of error-prone struct tags.

* [govalidator](https://github.com/asaskevich/govalidator) - package of validators and sanitizers for strings, numerics, slices and structs.

## Web servers

* [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) - powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go

## State Machines

* [Stateless](https://github.com/qmuntal/stateless) - library for creating state machines.

* [Transition](https://github.com/qor/transition) - state machine implementation.

* [StateMachine](https://github.com/Gurpartap/statemachine-go) - Declarative Finite-State Machines in Go

## Computer vision & recognition

* [gocv](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv) - package provides Go language bindings for the [OpenCV 4](http://opencv.org/) computer vision library.



## Blockchain

* [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) - Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Or Blockchain, for short.

* [blackholeDB](https://github.com/bregydoc/blackholeDB) - conceptual Key-Value distributed Database. HoleDB uses IPFS as decentralized filesystem, and BadgerDB as store for local key value pairs. (work in progress)

* [go-orbit-db](https://github.com/berty/go-orbit-db) - distributed peer-to-peer database on IPFS. This project intends to provide a fully compatible port of the JavaScript version in Go.
